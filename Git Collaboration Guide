🤝 GitHub Collaboration Guide

A Complete Workflow for Team Contributions

Welcome to the project!
This guide explains how to work collaboratively using Git, GitHub, and standard development workflows.

📌 1. Initial Setup

Before collaborating:

✅ Install Tools

Git → https://git-scm.com/downloads

VS Code / IntelliJ / PyCharm

Node.js (for frontend)

Python + virtualenv (for backend + GA)

Docker (optional but recommended)

✅ Configure Git (once)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"

📌 2. Forking the Repository

If you are external to the main repo, you must fork.

Go to the GitHub repository

Click Fork (top right)

GitHub creates a copy under your username

You will push changes to your fork → then open Pull Requests

📌 3. Cloning and Setup
Clone the Main or Forked Repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Meal-Planning-using-GA.git
cd Meal-Planning-using-GA

Add the Original Repository as Upstream (important)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dontbelikesdb/Meal-Planning-using-GA.git

Check remotes
git remote -v


Should show:

origin    <your fork>
upstream  <main/original>

📌 4. Branch Management
Branch Naming Convention

Use clear prefixes:

Purpose	Prefix	Example
Feature	feat/	feat/add-login-page
Fix	fix/	fix/recipe-api-bug
Docs	docs/	docs/update-readme
Refactor	refactor/	refactor/ga-module
Create a Branch
git checkout -b feat/new-feature

Switch Branch
git checkout main

Delete a Branch
git branch -d feat/new-feature

📌 5. Daily Workflow (Important!)

Every day before you start working:

1. Switch to main
git checkout main

2. Pull latest changes from main repo
git pull upstream main

3. Update your fork
git push origin main

4. Create a new branch for the day’s work
git checkout -b feat/todays-task


Then continue coding.

📌 6. Pull Request Process
Step-by-step

Commit your code on your feature branch

Push to your fork:

git push origin feat/todays-task


Go to GitHub → your fork

Click Compare & Pull Request

Fill PR template:

Summary of changes

Screenshot (if UI)

Linked issue number

Steps to test

Submit PR

Wait for code review

Apply requested changes

Reviewer approves → Merge

📌 7. Code Review Guidelines
As a Reviewer:

✔ Check code readability
✔ Check if feature follows architecture
✔ Confirm there are no security issues
✔ Look for duplication
✔ Run code locally if needed
✔ Suggest improvements, not insults
✔ Approve only when:

tests pass

CI passes

code quality is good

As an Author:

✔ Be open to feedback
✔ Commit updates requested in review
✔ Never argue—explain calmly if needed

📌 8. Conflict Resolution
When Git Shows a Merge Conflict:

Open the conflicted file

Find markers:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Incoming changes
>>>>>>> branch-name


Manually edit & keep correct version

Remove markers

Add resolved file:

git add filename


Continue merge:

git commit

Avoid conflicts by:

pulling latest code daily

not committing large chunks at once

using meaningful branches

📌 9. Essential Git Commands
Check status
git status

Stage changes
git add .

Commit
git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"

Push branch
git push origin branch-name

Fetch updates (no merge)
git fetch upstream

Merge updates
git merge upstream/main

Stash changes temporarily
git stash

Apply stashed changes
git stash pop

📌 10. Best Practices
✔ Commit small, frequent updates
✔ Use meaningful commit messages
✔ One PR = One Feature
✔ Never push directly to main
✔ Always create a feature branch
✔ Keep your fork updated every day
✔ Write clear documentation
✔ Use .env.example to show required variables
📌 11. Troubleshooting
❗“Permission denied” when pushing

You are pushing to the original repo.
Fix:

git push origin branch-name

❗"Your branch is behind 'upstream/main'"

Fix:

git pull upstream main

❗Merge conflicts in PR

Follow Conflict Resolution section above.

❗PR not showing latest changes

You forgot to push:

git push origin branch-name

❗Frontend/Backend not starting

Check:

Node version

Python env

Missing .env variables

Docker not installed
